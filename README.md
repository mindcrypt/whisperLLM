# WhisperLLM: Evading network security and censhorship by stegotexts

Over the last 10 years, many threat groups have employed stegomalware or other steganography-based techniques to attack organizations from all sectors and in all regions of the world. Some examples are: APT15/Vixen Panda, APT23/Tropic Trooper, APT29/Cozy Bear, APT32/OceanLotus, APT34/OilRig, APT37/ScarCruft, APT38/Lazarus Group, Duqu Group, Turla, Vawtrack, Powload, Lokibot, Ursnif, IceID, etc. To mitigate the impact of these attacks different proposals have been published. In Blackhat USA 2022 and BH ASIA 2023 we released the [Stegowiper](https://github.com/mindcrypt/stegowiper) tool that tries to reduce the success of these campaigns.
